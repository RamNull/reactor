# Automated PR Review Agent - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This PR adds an automated review agent that runs on every pull request in the repository. The agent provides immediate feedback on PR size, statistics, includes a quality checklist, and now responds intelligently to review comments.

## What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`)
A complete automation workflow that:
- Triggers on PR open, synchronize, and reopen events
- **NEW:** Triggers on review submissions and review comments
- Analyzes PR size and complexity
- Posts automated review comments
- Assigns size-based labels automatically
- **NEW:** Responds to reviewer questions and feedback automatically

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation (`.github/workflows/README.md`)
Updated documentation covering:
- Feature descriptions including new review response capability
- How the workflow operates
- Customization guide
- Troubleshooting tips
- Example outputs for both initial reviews and comment responses

## Key Features

### Automated Statistics
Every PR receives an automated comment showing:
```
## ðŸ¤– Automated PR Review

### PR Statistics
- **Files changed:** X
- **Lines added:** +Y
- **Lines deleted:** -Z
- **Total changes:** N
```

### Size-Based Labeling
Automatic labels help prioritize reviews:
- ðŸŸ¢ `size/XS` - Less than 50 lines (Quick review)
- ðŸŸ¢ `size/S` - 50-199 lines (Easy review)
- ðŸŸ¡ `size/M` - 200-499 lines (Medium complexity)
- ðŸŸ  `size/L` - 500-999 lines (Should be broken up)
- ðŸ”´ `size/XL` - 1000+ lines (Too large, needs splitting)

### Quality Checklist
Each PR gets a standardized checklist:
- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] Tests have been added/updated
- [ ] Documentation has been updated (if needed)
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] PR has been reviewed by at least one team member

### Intelligent Review Responses

- Detects questions and requests for clarification
- Provides context-aware guidance on:
  - Testing and test coverage
  - Documentation requirements
  - Breaking changes and compatibility
  - Performance considerations
  - Security best practices
- Prevents infinite loops by ignoring bot comments
