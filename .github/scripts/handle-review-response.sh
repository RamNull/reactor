Thank you for asking! Let me clarify:

            REPLY="${REPLY}**Regarding logging frameworks:**
Using a proper logging framework like SLF4J with Logback provides several benefits:
- Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Better performance with lazy evaluation
- Support for structured logging and log aggregation
- Production-ready features like log rotation
- Easy integration with monitoring tools

System.out.println writes directly to stdout and lacks these capabilities, making it unsuitable for production code."
        elif echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | grep -qiE "(why.*test|testing)"; then
            REPLY="${REPLY}**Regarding tests:**
Adding tests for new functionality ensures:
- Code works as expected
- Future changes don't break existing functionality (regression testing)
- Documentation of intended behavior
- Easier refactoring with confidence
- Better code quality and maintainability"
        elif echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | grep -qiE "(why.*documentation|docs)"; then
            REPLY="${REPLY}**Regarding documentation:**
Documentation helps:
- Other developers understand the code
- New team members onboard faster
- Users understand how to use features
- Maintainers understand design decisions
- Reduce technical debt over time"
        else
            REPLY="${REPLY}Based on your question, here's what I recommend:
- Review the relevant documentation in the repository
- Check if there are similar implementations you can reference
- Consider the long-term maintainability of the approach
- Think about how this will scale

If you need more specific guidance, please provide additional context about your use case."
